Assignment Submission for Module 2 Challenge
I was having trouble setting up my loops, so I looked up some of the code and basic structure to help me set up my 2 loops. The first loop scans the data and outputs the percent change, yearly change, and stock volume for each ticker and uses conditionals to apply conditional formatting to the yearly change column. The second loop goes through the data from the first loop and provides the tickers with the greatest % yearly increase, greatest % yearly decrease, and greatest total volume.
